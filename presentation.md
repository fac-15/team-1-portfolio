# Team Awesome!
##  How
- Looked for inspiration
- Spoke a lot about [this website](http://simoncorry.com/portfolio)
- Ultimately drew inspiration from: ![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*xejXp2v-UaWM7vakzJ6uOQ.jpeg)
- Basic HTML structure
- Content and styling
- Referred back to user stories
- Finish styling
- Other features - navbar
- Fixing issues 

## Why
- meet user stories
- Nielsens's 10 usability
    - Consistency & Standards
    - Error Prevention
    - Flexibility and Efficiency of Use
    - Minimalist Design

## How did we pair and split up the work?
- discussed structure rough design
- website sections and created skelton HTML
- paired up on sections needed to be created. if we hadnt worked together  at the beginning then on rotation.
- work was split in line with what we have expertise in from the research teams the previous day & capabilities.
## Website Demo
## Our Code
### Specific Sections
- Icons
- Explain media queries - in particular grid-template-rows
- Smooth scrolling difficulties
- Mobile navbar

### What we learned
- GIT IS HARD BUT ALSO GREAT
- There's usually more than one solution to each challenge, and talking through things helps workout the best approach for all of us.

### What we didn't get to, or would have liked to do

- outstanding issues
- add javascript
- make a project plan.

## Dealing with issues
- Making the connection between icons and team members obvious in mobile

### What was hard
    
- Fixing conflicts takes practice
- Different team members work differently, and it takes some time to find the right rythem for the entire team (for example, working on local files vs. working in the console)
- Git flow process (long and can be complex)

### What we're proud of
- Team issues 
- We've managed to achieve a significant amount of work on issues this morning
- Being able to stop working at 18:00, for lunch, etc
- Good communication (most of the time)
